## First Post

I finally got around to setting up a Github Pages site. The ability to write posts in markdown and have Jekyll render it into html is beyond easy. You can just type something up in the terminal and post it if you like. I've found Github to be indispendsible to my tinkering with Python. I've also become a huge fan of Atom after moving over to it from gvim/macvim. In short, it was about time. 

Thanks Evan Will for the tutorial!
